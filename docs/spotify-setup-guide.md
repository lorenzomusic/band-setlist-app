- Verify environment variables are saved and deployment is complete

**"Redirect URI mismatch"**

**"Environment variables not found"**
- Go to Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
- Make sure all three Spotify variables are set
- Redeploy your app after adding environment variables

**"No duration found" vs "Found duration"**
- Spotify has the best duration data, so enable it first
- Fallback order: Spotify ‚Üí iTunes ‚Üí MusicBrainz
- Some very new or obscure songs might not be on Spotify

**"Failed to create playlist"**
- Check you're connected to Spotify (green status)
- Verify your account has playlist creation permissions
- Some corporate accounts may have restrictions

**"Song not found on Spotify"**
- Not all songs are available on Spotify (licensing)
- Try editing the song title/artist for better matching
- Consider alternate versions or covers

### **Rate Limits**

- **Spotify API**: 100 requests per minute (handled automatically)
- **Duration updates**: ~4 songs per second (respectful rate limiting)
- **Playlist creation**: Up to 100 songs per request

### **Permissions Required**

The app requests these Spotify permissions:
- **playlist-modify-public**: Create public playlists

- **user-read-private**: Get your user profile
- **user-read-email**: Get your email (for account identification)

## üéµ **Advanced Tips**

### **Optimizing Song Matching**

1. **Clean Song Data**
   - Use exact song titles as they appear on Spotify
   - Include featured artists: "Song ft. Artist" or "Song (feat. Artist)"
   - Avoid extra text: "Song - Live Version" ‚Üí "Song"

2. **Artist Names**
   - Use primary artist name as it appears on Spotify
   - For collaborations, use the main artist
   - Avoid band name variations: "The Beatles" not "Beatles"

3. **Confidence Scoring**
   - 90-100%: Excellent match (automatically selected)
   - 70-89%: Good match (review recommended)
   - Below 70%: Poor match (manual review needed)

### **Playlist Organization**

- **Naming Convention**: "{Event} - {Date}" or "{Venue} Setlist"
